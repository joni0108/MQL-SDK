# Contributing
## Ways of Contribution
* **By reporting bugs**: This will help us to fix them on future updates.
* **By suggesting**: If you have an idea of a module, package, or feature that you want in the SDK, leave it in the Issues tab and we will implement it.
* **By suggesting libraries**: If you know or even have a library that want to incorporate in the SDK, leave it in the Issues section or make a pull request on the `Open` branch and I will check it out.
* **By improving the actual code**: Maybe optimize it, or adding new functions or classes to actual modules will help.
* **By sharing it**: Sharing the repository is forum will help others developers to reach it, and more developers means more improvements to the project.
